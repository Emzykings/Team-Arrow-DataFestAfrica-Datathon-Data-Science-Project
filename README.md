Fraud Detection for Online Payment Platform
Overview
The Fraud Detection dataset serves as a vital asset for the business, offering valuable insights and opportunities for enhancing the security and trustworthiness of the online payment platform. This dataset encapsulates transactions and user-related data collected over time from our platform. The primary objective of this project is to develop an advanced predictive model that can effectively identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

Project Notebooks
This GitHub repository houses the code and documentation for the project. Below, you'll find a summary of the key notebooks and their contents:

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Notebook**
In this notebook, we perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the provided dataset. Key steps include:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, data type conversions, and data quality checks.

Summary statistics: Gaining insights into the dataset's distribution, central tendencies, and variations.

Visualization: Creating visualizations to better understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.

Feature engineering: Crafting new features that could be valuable for model development.

Extracting meaningful information from date and time columns.

Engineering time-based features that capture temporal patterns.

Incorporating these features into the dataset for improved model performance.

**2. Modeling Notebook**
This notebook is dedicated to building and evaluating machine learning models for fraud detection. Key components include:

Model selection: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification.

Model training: Training and fine-tuning models on the preprocessed dataset.

Model evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics.

Deep learning architecture: Implementing a deep learning neural network for fraud detection.

Unsupervised learning: Employing K-Means clustering as an unsupervised learning approach.

Encoding categorical variables: Preparing categorical features for model input.

Scaling and normalization: Standardizing numerical features to facilitate model convergence.

The dataset encompasses a wide range of features, including but not limited to:

Transaction Data: Transaction ID, User ID, Transaction Amount, Transaction Date and Time, Merchant ID, Payment Method, Country Code, and Transaction Type.

User Data: User Age, User Gender, User Account Status, User's Transaction History, User's Credit Score, and User's Email Domain.

Merchant Data: Merchant Category and Merchant's Reputation Score.

Transaction Details: Transaction Status, Location Distance, Time Taken for Transaction, and Transaction Currency.

Device Information: Device Type, IP Address, Browser Type, and Operating System.

Additional Context: Transaction Purpose and User's Device Location.
